## Computational Inefficiencies and Anti-Patterns

### Inefficient Data Fetching and State Management
One of the issue would be that prices are fetched every time the component mounts without any caching mechanism, leading to unnecessary API calls.
Improvement can be done by implementing caching or a global state management solution to avoid redundant API calls.

### Incorrect Error Handling

There is an issue in using `console.err` instead of `console.error`.
`console.error` should be used to properly log errors.

### Inefficient and Incorrect Sorting and Filtering
Filtering and sorting are performed inside the `useMemo` hook, but the logic is inefficient.
Therefore, we can refactor the sorting and filtering logic for clarity and efficiency.

### Incorrect Priority Calculation
The priority function and balance checks can be improved. The priority comparison is incorrectly using variables (`lhsPriority`), which are undefined.
To improve, we need to ensure all variables are correctly defined and used in the logic.

### Unnecessary Mapping
The balances are mapped twice (`sortedBalances.map` and `formattedBalances.map`) leading to inefficient processing.
To improve it, we can combine the mapping operations into a single pass.
